About Me
I'm Avni, a sixth form student at Cambridge Maths School.
I have experience in Python, JS, HTML, CSS, and some R. I've run multiple coding workshops for young people across the country, and even in Kenya and India. My passion is in AI and machine learning, and I plan to take AI or computer science as a course in university

Projects 
Project work: Learnign about Mahcine Learning: worked in a team to train a machine learning model (created using scikit-learn) to detect fraudulent bank transactions from a dataframe of different bank transactions: 
Repo here: https://github.com/IvanLeung36/machine_learning 
Did a presentation with my team to explain how we chose an algorithm, trained our model and evaluated it’s performance 
Made a website as part of my schoolwork: https://avni.2024.compsci.me/ 
Festival of Code (a yearly event for kids of all ages in Wapping High School, where you spend a week making a project): 
Use MIT App inventor to make an app to revise taekwondo theory 
Made an AR filter in Snapchat 
Made a 3D website 
Used Anvil to make a fridge app (track what’s in your fridge) 
Worked with someone else to make an unhosted website that gives a map of the UK divided by constituency and colour-coded by the winning party of each in the 2024 election. Repo here: https://github.com/Kingsley-Godfrey/interactive-map-of-the-UK-by-constituency 
Have an old profile website from when I was a child called tinkeringneurons: https://tinkeringneurons.com/ 
Made 3D websites with a three.js and WebGL course: https://threejs-journey.com/ and the websites are here: 
https://rainbow-alphabet-spaghetti.vercel.app/ 
https://17-haunted-house-blue.vercel.app/ 
https://avni-website-portfolio.deno.dev/ (WIP)
